# Nmap and Metasploit Task

This repository contains documentation for a task involving Nmap and Metasploit conducted entirely through the console.

## Task Description
The task focuses on utilizing Nmap for network scanning and reconnaissance, followed by using Metasploit for exploiting vulnerabilities discovered during the scanning process. The steps involved in the task are outlined below:

### Steps:
1. **Check IP of Victim Machine**: Determine the IP address of the victim machine.
2. **IP of Attacking Machine**: Identify the IP address of the attacking machine.
3. **Nmap Scan with "-A"**: Perform an Nmap scan with the "-A" flag for comprehensive OS and service detection.
4. **Execute Scripts**: Execute any scripts or additional commands identified during the scanning process.
5. **Launch Metasploit**: Open the Metasploit console.
6. **Set RHOST**: Set the remote host (victim machine) IP address.
7. **Show Payload**: Display available payloads for exploitation.
8. **Run Payload**: Execute the chosen payload to exploit vulnerabilities on the victim machine.
9. **Screensharing**: Establish screen sharing or remote access to the victim machine.
   
### Backdoor:
To establish persistent access to the victim machine, a backdoor is created by generating a text file on the victim machine.

## Usage
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
